Extending Edalize
=================

Edalize comes with support for a large number of tools and flows, but there are always more. This section will look at how to add more tools and flows to Edalize, either as contributions to the official Edalize distribution, or as code that can live outside of the Edalize code base. The process for these two alternative ways of extending Edalize is mostly the same, but `Using external tools or flows`_ describes the extra steps for the latter use-case.
